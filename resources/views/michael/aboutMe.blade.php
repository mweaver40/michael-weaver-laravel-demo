        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hi I am Michael. I am not going over
all my extensive software development background here but you
can download my <a href="{{URL::to('/') . '/Resume6.doc'}}">Resume</a> 
to get that. I am a
software developer who spent over 25 years  learning to write small
and large applications in a corporate setting with large numbers of
developers and in small companies with groups all the way down to
just me. I don't have a rigid way of writing software since the whole
paradigm seems to go through upheaval every 10 years or so. I do tend
to write things in an object oriented manner but I have no hard core
beliefs that things can only be done one way correctly.</P>
<h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whatever you want done! As I mentioned
I have been doing this job a long time and I am willing to do pretty
much anything you need done. I can pick up new frameworks, languages
and methodology generally on my own with minimal guidance from my coworkers.
At this point in my career I am willing to help others with the tough
projects or I can do the mundane but important maintenance tasks that
need doing.  I have trained myself as a full stack developer but I am
probably better on the back-end then the front end.  
</P>
<h2>Where do I want to be?</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I am currently living in Boynton Beach
South Florida and I would prefer to stay there for now but I could be
enticed to leave for the right position in the right place. Money is
important but more important is a job I like in a place my wife and I
like to live and time to enjoy our life. My ideal job would probably
be a telecommute job/contract where I could set my own hours or some
mix of that and showing up to work at the office. I worked corporate
jobs for many years so I am not opposed to showing up every day at
the job and working in a somewhat political environment. I don't mind
doing short or long term contract work and would consider fixed price
contracts 
</P>
<h4>About my sabbatical</h4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">I took a
sabbatical after over 25 years of continuous work for some things I
wanted to do like remodeling a house, moving to a small town and
learning technical scuba diving. I had no idea what an issue this
would be with some recruiters. All I can say is I am back now and
have spent extensive time refreshing and enhancing my skills which I
demonstrate on my <a href="{{URL::to('/')}}">website</a>. I think if you
look at my background you will see someone who will be an asset to
your company and has the maturity to prove themselves in whatever way
works for your company.
